i made a neural network to identify captchas

it took way too long

decent accuracy? idk man, just look at the results or smth

i made the nn architecture on my own. its very scuffed and probably not the best. I did all the calculations in a spreadsheet ðŸ˜­

dataset is generated, see captchagen.py.

very unoptimized, so expect training to be slow if you are checking out the main program ðŸ˜­ðŸ’€

extract dataset from zip before using
